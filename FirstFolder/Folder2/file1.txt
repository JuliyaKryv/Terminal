Quality assurance (QA) is the term used in service industries to describe the systematic efforts taken to ensure that the product(s) delivered to customer(s) meet the contractual and other agreed-upon performance, design, reliability, and maintainability expectations for that customer. 

This defect prevention aspect of quality assurance differs from the defect detection aspect of quality control and has been referred to as a shift left since it focuses on quality efforts earlier in product development and production (i.e., a shift to the left of a linear process diagram reading left to right) and on avoiding defects in the first place rather than correcting them after the fact.

The terms "quality assurance" and "quality control" are often used interchangeably to refer to ways of ensuring the quality of a service or product.
 For instance, the term "assurance" is often used in a context such as: Implementation of inspection and structured testing as a measure of quality assurance set software project where inspection and structured testing are the measurement phase of a quality assurance strategy referred to as the DMAIC model (define, measure, analyze, improve, control). DMAIC is a data-driven quality strategy used to improve processes. The term "control" is the fifth phase of this strategy.
